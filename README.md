# OpenCV Project - Document Scanner
---
### This is a Python script that uses OpenCV to create a document scanner. The script captures images from a camera (Webcam, index 1) and detects the document in the frame. It then applies perspective transformation to get a top-down view of the detected document and saves the scanned image.
